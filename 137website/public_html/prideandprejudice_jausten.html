        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            Pride and Prejudice is a novel of manners by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The 
            story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, 
            upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the 
            British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living 
            near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London. Page 2 of a letter from 
            Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentions Pride and 
            Prejudice, using its working title First Impressions. Set in England in the early 19th century, 
            Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after 
            the rich and eligible Mr Bingley and his status-conscious friend, Mr Darcy, have moved into
            their neighbourhood. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, 
            Jane, Darcy has difficulty adapting to local society and repeatedly clashes with the second-
            eldest Bennet daughter, Elizabeth. Though Austen set the story at the turn of the 19th 
            century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of 
            "most loved books." It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, 
            selling over 20 million copies, and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. 
            Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance 
            of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes.
