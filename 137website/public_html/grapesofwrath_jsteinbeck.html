        <p>
            Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles 
            the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven 
            from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials 
            and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots 
            evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet 
            plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between 
            the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical 
            strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of 
            equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and 
            transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.
