        <p>
            The ambitious but ill-educated, illusioned, and immature Clyde Griffiths is raised by poor and 
            devoutly religious parents who force him to participate in their street missionary work, and on 
            reaching young adulthood takes low-status jobs as a soda jerk and then as a bellhop at a top Kansas 
            City hotel. There, his more sophisticated colleagues introduce him to alcohol and prostitutes. 

            Clyde enjoys his new lifestyle and becomes infatuated with the mercenary Hortense Briggs, who 
            exploits this characteristic of Clyde by compelling him to buy her an expensive jacket in exchange 
            for love, even though she clearly does not want him to be her partner. Hortense instead wants 
            another person named Sparser, and this is clear to Clyde who is immediately and extremely jealous, 
            but Hortense repeatedly reassures Clyde that she loves him, though she really wants him just for the jacket...
