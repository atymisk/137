        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            Savagely ironic, it portrays man as foolish at best, and at worst, not much more than an ape.
            The direct and unadorned narrative describes four remarkable journies of ship's surgeon Lemuel Gulliver, 
            among them, one to the land of Lilliput, where six-inch-high inhabitants bicker over trivialities; and 
            another to Brobdingnag, a land where giants reduce man to insignificance. Written with disarming 
            simplicity and careful attention to detail, this classic is diverse in its appeal: for children, it 
            remains an enchanting fantasy. For adults, it is a witty parody of political life in Swift's time and a 
            scathing send-up of manners and morals in 18th-century England.
