        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            A Confederacy of Dunces is an American comic masterpiece. John Kennedy Toole's hero, one 
            Ignatius J. Reilly, is "huge, obese, fractious, fastidious, a latter-day Gargantua, a Don 
            Quixote of the French Quarter. His story bursts with wholly original characters, denizens 
            of New Orleans' lower depths, incredibly true-to-life dialogue, and the zaniest series of 
            high and low comic adventures" (Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times).
