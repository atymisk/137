        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring was first published in three serialized excerpts in 
            the New Yorker in June of 1962. The book appeared in September of that year and the 
            outcry that followed its publication forced the banning of DDT and spurred revolutionary 
            changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water. Carson’s passionate concern for the 
            future of our planet reverberated powerfully throughout the world, and her eloquent book 
            was instrumental in launching the environmental movement. It is without question one of the 
            landmark books of the twentieth century.
