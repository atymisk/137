        <p>
            During a business visit to Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania, a young English 
            solicitor finds himself at the center of a series of horrifying incidents. Jonathan 
            Harker is attacked by three phantom women, observes the Count's transformation from 
            human to bat form, and discovers puncture wounds on his own neck that seem to have 
            been made by teeth. Harker returns home upon his escape from Dracula's grim fortress, 
            but a friend's strange malady — involving sleepwalking, inexplicable blood loss, and 
            mysterious throat wounds — initiates a frantic vampire hunt.
