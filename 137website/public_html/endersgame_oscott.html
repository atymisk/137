        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government 
            agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" 
            Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he 
            loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the 
            soldier-training program but didn't make the cut--young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting 
            Battle School for rigorous military training.

            Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at 
            mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers, Ender 
            suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an 
            unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he 
            is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved 
            sister. 

            Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war
            with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been 
            underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in 
            very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If the world 
            survives, that is.
